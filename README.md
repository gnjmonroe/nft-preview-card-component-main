## Plan

### Goals

- Complete the project with reasonable accuracy.
- Estimate and budget time.
- Refresh semantic HTML skills.
- Refresh SCSS skills.
- Practice outlining a project and workflow.

### Time Estimate

- HTML [15']
- CSS (structure) [15']
- CSS (fill-in & fine-tuning) [30']
- CSS (hover states) [15']
- Final Check [30']

Total Estimated Time: [105']

## Review

### Time

- Plan / Outline [28']
- HTML [14']
- CSS (structure) [16']
- CSS (filling-in & fine-tuning) [121']
- CSS (hover states) [21']
- Final Check [19']

Total Actual Time: [219']

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Adobe XD

### Challenges

- The price-time section
  - Had to look up pseudo-elements and flexbox.
- The image's hover state
  - Had to look up positioning and display attributes.

### Lessons Learned

- Planning and outlining take time and I need to remember to plan for that time.
- The more that I can specifically resolve in the planning/outline stage, the quicker I can finish the project.
- I did a decent job of predicting the time required for the project, outside of the bulk of the CSS work.
- I need to find a way to plan/outline the CSS work (and in the future, JS work) without pseudo-code.

### Next Steps

- Do another project to reinforce the skills used in this project.
- Start thinking about how to explain a project and the decision-making in it (why a certain architecture was chosen, what the priorities are). This is also tied to in-code documentation practices.
- Continue keeping the HTML and CSS neat and readable.

### Resources

- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - The official BEM documentation.
- [CSS Reset Documentation](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - The base for the CSS reset that I use.
- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - Generally helpful best practices regarding Sass/SCSS and the base folder architecture that I use (the 7-1 pattern)
